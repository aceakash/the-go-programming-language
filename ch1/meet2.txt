Not having to remember variable types is amazing!

Scanner.Scan was really easy to use

There is no ternary operator in Go. You have to write a short if-else.

In dup2, countLines could have been countLines(input io.Reader) instead of countLines(f *os.File)

map variables are references

a built-in set type would have been nice

had to implement contains(haystack, needle)
